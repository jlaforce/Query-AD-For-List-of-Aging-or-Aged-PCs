# Query-AD-For-List-of-Aging-or-Aged-PCs
This script will scan your AD and Export a CSV list of Pcs that have not had activity, prior to your set number of days tolerance you input. 

# Requirements
1. You need to be an Admin with AD privileges.
2. You need to have the latest RSAT tools installed and enabled. I have tested this with the older physical install on the latest Windows 10, should work the same with the built in tools as well. 
3. Of course, make sure you set your local ExecutionPolicy from something other than "Disabled". 

# You Canz Halp!!

I threw up a new website, if you like this script, like any of my blog stuff, please share. 
I'm in the market for a new home, a new challenge, a new place to automate.
So you can help a brother out by sharing some of this content, the sites content, or just the site itself. 
I would super preeeesh, and it would help me out a lot. 
Or if you want me to look at any of your work, or help troubleshoot, let me know! ::I'll remove any mention of ya, unless you are cool with me blogging about it. If that's ok, I'll let you review before you post it. Just let me know how to mention or "call back" at ya.::
